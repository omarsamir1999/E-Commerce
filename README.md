## E-Commerce Microservices Project

Welcome to the E-Commerce Microservices project, a culmination of our journey at JobHacker training. This project represents our collective effort to design and implement a robust and scalable e-commerce system consisting of seven distinct microservices: **User**, **Store**, **Product**, **Order**, **Coupon**, **Notification**, and **Bank**. Leveraging the power of Spring Boot and various best practices, we have developed a versatile and efficient platform to meet the demands of modern e-commerce.
